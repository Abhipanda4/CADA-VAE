## Generative approaches to Zero-Shot Learning

This repo contains a pytorch implementation for the paper: [Generalized Zero- and Few-Shot Learning via Aligned Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01784).

Currently, only Awa2 dataset is supported. More datasets will be added soon.

## WORK IN PROGRESS

# Results

# TODO:
* Add CUB and Awa1 datasets
* improve accuracies
* extra discriminator benefits?
* Improve README
